Data Schema explanation for For-Hired Vehicle (FHV) data.

Data ranges and types can be found in my profile_data.scala
Data length is fixed for each of the entries.

Column Name:
startDate
Description:
This is the start date for an FHV trip record. It is in the format of “YYYY-mm-dd”. For example, Sep.1 2018 would be 2018-09-01. That means a FHV trip record is started at Sep.1 2018.
Data Type:
The data type is string. The reason why I use string is because it is much easy to compare string value and extract the useful information from string. That’s why I did not convert it to Date format.



Column Name:
startTime
Description:
This is the start time for an FHV trip record. It is a supplement of the startDate. It is in the format “HH-MM-ss”. For example, precisely half past ten o’clock at night would be 22:30:00. That means a FHV trip record is started at precisely half past ten o’clock.
Data Type:
The data type is string. The reason why I use string is because it is much easy to compare string value and extract the useful information from string. That’s why I did not convert it to Date format.



Column Name:
endDate
Description:
This is the ending date for an FHV trip record. It is in the format of “YYYY-mm-dd”. For example, Sep.1 2018 would be 2018-09-01. That means a FHV trip record is ended at Sep.1 2018.
Data Type:
The data type is string. The reason why I use string is because it is much easy to compare string value and extract the useful information from string. That’s why I did not convert it to Date format.



Column Name:
endTime
Description:
This is the ending time for an FHV trip record. It is a supplement of the endDate. It is in the format “HH-MM-ss”. For example, precisely half past ten o’clock at night would be 22:30:00. That means a FHV trip record is ended at precisely half past ten o’clock.
Data Type:
The data type is string. The reason why I use string is because it is much easy to compare string value and extract the useful information from string. That’s why I did not convert it to Date format.



Column Name:
startLoc:
Description:
This is the starting location of the FHV trip data. The number in this field represents/maps to a TCL taxi zone. For example “16” means the FHV trip record starts at zone 16.
Data Type:
The data type is string. The reason why I use string is because there is no significance in terms of largeness of number in this case. They are all just mapping to a zone which specified by a shape file. Using Int/Log as the data type for this column would cause confusion.


Column Name:
endLoc:
Description:
This is the ending location of the FHV trip data. The number in this field represents/maps to a TCL taxi zone. For example “16” means the FHV trip record ends at zone 16.
Data Type:
The data type is string. The reason why I use string is because there is no significance in terms of largeness of number in this case. They are all just mapping to a zone which specified by a shape file. Using Int/Log as the data type for this column would cause confusion.
